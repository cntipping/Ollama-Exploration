Similarly, for the fish intelligence part, it provided some knowledge but in the response, it directly linked the intelligence to specific cognitive abilities like memory.\n",

       "The smoking and lung cancer input included statistical data, so the response highlighted those numbers to emphasize the risk increase. \n",

Golf scoring can be tricky because each hole has a par, and players aim to get scores as low as possible. However, in some formats like Stableford or match play, points are awarded based on performance relative to par.\n",

From what I understand, in most scoring systems, like Stableford, players earn points based on their performance relative to par. So actually, lower scores are better because you're getting closer to the par value for each hole.\n",

       "But wait, in the new input provided by the user, after the initial four lines (which include two positive labels), they added:\n",

       "But in the example given by the user, after the initial positive and negative labels, they provided three more lines:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. \"Wow that movie was rad!\" – positive\n",
       "2. \"Positive\" – positive (since it's a label)\n",

       "4. \"Negative\" – negative\n",

       "So for the new input:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The first line is \"Wow that movie was rad!\" which is clearly positive.\n",

       "3. Next is \"What a horrible show!\" which is negative.\n",
       "4. Then \"Negative\" again, which is clearly negative as it's an explicit label.\n",

       "So putting this together, the output should list each line with its corresponding Positive or Negative label based on content. So:\n",
       "\n",

       "2. \"Positive\" – Positive (since it's a positive statement)\n",

       "4. \"Negative\" – Negative\n",

       "The user provided an example where four positive statements were labeled Positive, then two negative ones as Negative. Now, for their new input, which includes three more lines after the initial labels, I need to apply the same logic.\n",

       "Wait, maybe each line is its own statement and needs to be labeled based on its content or if it's already a label (which would still be positive/negative).\n",
       "\n",
       "So in the first four lines:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. \"Wow that movie was rad!\" – Positive\n",
       "2. \"Positive\" – Positive\n",
       "3. \"What a horrible show!\" – Negative\n",
       "4. \"Negative\" – Negative\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, after that, there are three more lines from the user's message:\n",
       "\n",
       "5. \"Wow that movie was rad!\" – Positive\n",
       "6. \"Positive\" – Positive\n",
       "7. \"What a horrible show!\" – Negative\n",
       "8. \"Negative\" – Negative\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, no, because in their example, they had four initial statements and then two more to label. Now they have added three lines after the initial four.\n",
       "\n",
       "So perhaps each of those three new lines needs to be labeled based on their content or as Positive/Negative if they are labels themselves.\n",
       "\n",
       "But \"Positive\" is a label that would still indicate positivity, same with \"Negative\".\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, maybe it's about whether the line itself contributes to the sentiment. For example:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Lines that express positive feelings (like \"Wow that movie was rad!\") should be labeled Positive.\n",
       "- Lines that express negative feelings (\"What a horrible show!\") should be Negative.\n",
       "- Lines that are explicit labels (\"Positive\" or \"Negative\") would have their own label, but perhaps in this context, since they're being used as indicators, maybe the entire line is considered Positive or Negative based on what it's indicating.\n",
       "\n",
       "But I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it simply: Each line from the user should be evaluated for its sentiment and labeled accordingly. So:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. \"Wow that movie was rad!\" – Positive\n",
       "2. \"Positive\" – Positive (since it's affirming)\n",
       "3. \"What a horrible show!\" – Negative\n",
       "4. \"Negative\" – Negative\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, after these four lines, the user provided three more lines:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Line 5: \"Wow that movie was rad!\" – Positive\n",
       "- Line 6: \"Positive\" – Positive\n",
       "- Line 7: \"What a horrible show!\" – Negative\n",
       "\n",
       "But wait, in their example, they had two additional lines to label. Now they have provided three. So perhaps the output should include these as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "So putting it all together:\n",
       "\n",
       "Each line is labeled based on its content or if it's already a label (Positive/Negative). So:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. \"Wow that movie was rad!\" – Positive\n",
