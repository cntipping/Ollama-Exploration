To determine the distance and the age of a cluster by this method, we must take
account of interstellar dust, which scatters light from the stars and makes them
appear dimmer. Because blue light is more strongly scattered, the stars appear
redder as well as dimmer. If we did not allow for the effects of dust, the isochrone
would appear as the dotted line, which is clearly too blue at mV ≈ 5 to fit the
observations. Similarly, if we had computed our isochrone for stars with much less
than the solar metal abundance, it would not have been a good fit to the observed
brightness and colors.
Open clusters such as the Pleiades can contain up to several hundred stars,
bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction. Table 2.2 shows that cluster
luminosities generally fall in the range 100L⊙ to 30 000L⊙. The central density
can be as high as 100L⊙ pc−3 but is frequently less; the core radius, where the
surface brightness falls to half its central value, is typically a few parsecs. The stars
have small random speeds, below 1 km s−1. The mass-to-light ratio is generally
below unity; it increases with the cluster’s age as the luminous massive stars die.
This ratio is hard to determine, because the diffuse outskirts of the cluster contain
disproportionately many of the dim stars that contribute most of the cluster’s mass,
but little of its light. We will see in Section 3.2 how this mass segregation can
develop.
Open clusters are quite often surrounded by gas and dust, and they always lie
close to the plane of the disk. The youngest cluster in Table 2.2, NGC 3603, is
2.2 The stars in the Galaxy 79
near the Galactic center. Only∼1% of its visible light can reach us, so we must
study it in the infrared. In other galaxies, we see open clusters in the spiral arms.
Unfortunately we cannot see most of the Milky Way’s open clusters, because
visible light does not travel well through the dust in the disk. We can make a fairly
complete map of the clusters only within about 5 kpc of the Sun.
Only about 5% of the 1200 or so known open clusters are more than 1 Gyr old,
and most have ages less than 300 Myr; the nearby Hyades cluster is about 600 Myr
old. Because most of a cluster’s light comes from its brightest stars, the color of
its total or integrated light gives us a rough estimate of its age. For example, the
Pleiades cluster has B− V= −0.05, close to the color of its most luminous stars
that are still on the main sequence; see Table 1.4. As the massive stars die, and
more of the cluster’s light comes from red giants, its color becomes redder. We can
use observations of nearby clusters, and the theory of stellar evolution, to relate
a cluster’s color to its age and metal abundance. When we observe star clusters
in other galaxies, generally we measure only the integrated light. Comparing a
cluster’s color with clusters in the Milky Way gives us an estimate of its age and
the composition of its stars.
Outside Gould’s Belt, most of the known open clusters younger than 300 Myr
lie within 50 pc of the Galactic midplane. The older clusters, like the old stars
of the thin disk, have a larger scale height, hz ≈ 375 pc. Clusters older than a
gigayear are found mainly in the outer Galaxy, beyond the Sun’s orbit, where
the gravitational forces are weaker. They are also relatively well populated and
compact. Younger clusters are scattered more uniformly in Galactocentric radius;
many have larger sizes or fewer members, and so are more fragile and prone to
fall apart. Since the gravitational attraction of open clusters does not bind them
together very strongly, they tend to be pulled apart as they pass through the spiral
arms of the disk, and also to dissolve because of the gravitational pull of the
cluster stars on each other. The old clusters that we see today are probably the
robust survivors of a much larger population.
NGC 3603 is a very young and massive cluster; in the central parsec are
several O3 stars, each with L∼ 30 000L⊙. The stars are no more than 5 Myr old,
and may be younger. Because its most massive stars are still shining, it is hugely
more luminous than the other clusters in Table 2.2. It is a smaller version of the
super-star-clusters formed in starburst galaxies. Here, starbirth is so vigorous that
it will consume the galaxy’s supply of cool gas within∼300 Myr. (Recall from
Section 2.2 that the Milky Way will not run out of gas for at least 2–3 Gyr.) We
will discuss starbursts further in Section 7.1.
Since elements heavier than helium are produced in the interiors of stars,
they become more abundant as the Universe ages. Figure 2.9 showed that F stars
older than 10 Gyr are much more likely to be iron-poor than are the younger stars.
So we might expect that old open clusters, which formed earlier in the life of
the Milky Way, should have lower metal abundances than the younger clusters.
Surprisingly, this is not so; the old cluster NGC 6791 is as metal-rich as the Sun.

There is considerable scatter in the chemical composition of open clusters at all
ages. The buildup of metals in the Galaxy must have proceeded quite unevenly:
some regions even recently were relatively poor in these elements. Open clusters
further from the Galactic center are more likely to be metal-poor; the outer Milky
Way seems to be enriching itself more slowly than the inner parts.
The globular clusters are very different from open clusters; they contain far
more stars, much more tightly packed. The brightest of the Milky Way’s 150 or
so known globulars is ω Centauri; with L ≈ 106 L⊙ it contains about a million
stars. In Figure 2.13 we see 47 Tucanae, another luminous cluster; Table 2.3 shows
that dimmer clusters range down to 104 L⊙. The stellar density is roughly constant
inside the core radius: rc ≈ 5 pc. The stars of globular clusters have higher random
speeds σr than those of stars in the open clusters of Table 2.2. Globular clusters
around Fornax, a small nearby dwarf galaxy, are very similar to those in the Milky
Way. At some outer radius rt, usually beyond 30 pc, the density of stars drops
sharply toward zero. This is the tidal radius or truncation radius. Stars beyond
this point are so loosely bound to the cluster that they can be swept away by the
‘tidal’ gravitational force of the Milky Way as the cluster orbits around it. We will
study this process further in Section 4.1.
None of the Milky Way’s globular clusters is younger than several gigayears,
and most are much older. The two color–magnitude diagrams of Figure 2.14 show
no young stars at all. The globular cluster 47 Tucanae is more than 10 Gyr old. Its
stars have only 15% of the solar abundance of metals, so the main sequence ends
with stars a little bluer and more luminous than the Sun. As in the Pleiades, the
main sequence is very narrow because all the stars are the same age and have the
same composition. Brighter stars fall on a narrow red giant branch, or on the hor-
izontal branch with MV ≈ 0. Like the local disk stars that populate the red clump
